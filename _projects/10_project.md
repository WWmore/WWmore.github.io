To represent smooth geometric shapes by coarse polygonal meshes, visible edges often follow special families of curves on a surface to achieve visually pleasing results.
Important examples of such families are principal curvature lines, asymptotic lines or
geodesics. In a surprisingly big amount of use-cases, these curves form an orthogonal net. While the condition of orthogonality between smooth curves on a surface is
straightforward, the discrete counterpart, namely orthogonal quad meshes, is not. In
this paper, we study the definition of discrete orthogonality based on equal diagonal
lengths in every quadrilateral. We embed this definition in the theory of discrete differential geometry and highlight its benefits for practical applications. We demonstrate
the versatility of this approach by combining discrete orthogonality with other classical constraints known from discrete differential geometry. Orthogonal multi-nets, i.e.
meshes where discrete orthogonality holds on any parameter rectangle, receive an indepth analysis.
