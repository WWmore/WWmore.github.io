##### **Abstract**
We solve the task of representing free forms by an arrangement of panels
that are manufacturable by precise isometric bending of surfaces made from
a small number of molds. In fact we manage to solve the paneling task with
surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature alone. This includes the case of
developable surfaces which exhibit zero curvature. Our computations are
based on an existing discrete model of isometric mappings between surfaces
which for this occasion has been refined to obtain higher numerical accuracy.
Further topics are interesting connections of the paneling problem with the
geometry of Killing vector fields, designing and actuating isometries, curved
folding in the double-curved case, and quad meshes with rigid faces that are
nevertheless flexible

Fig.: Smooth freeform skins from flexible panels. It turns out that constant
Gaussian curvature surfaces, i.e., spheres and pseudospheres, provide almost
universal molds for the manufacturing of panels bending isometrically. Here
a design by Zaha Hadid Architects is covered by panels struck from a small
number of spherical molds (red) and pseudospherical molds (blue), as well
as single-curved panels that are intrinsically flat (white)

Fig.1: Infinitesimal isometries tangential to surfaces (Killing fields) exist on
surfaces isometric to rotational surfaces like the example at right. Otherwise
vector fields that are as Killing as possible yield information on paneling.
The color coding is according to Gaussian curvature — true Killing fields
must follow its level sets.
