##### **Abstract**
Geodesic parallel coordinates are orthogonal nets on surfaces where one
of the two families of parameter lines are geodesic curves. We describe a
discrete version of these special surface parameterizations and show that
they are very useful for specific applications, most of which are related to
the design and fabrication of surfaces in architecture. With the new discrete surface model, it is easy to control strip widths between neighboring
geodesics. This facilitates tasks such as cladding a surface with strips of
originally straight flat material or designing geodesic gridshells and timber
rib shells. It is also possible to model nearly developable surfaces. These are
characterized by geodesic strips with almost constant strip widths and are
used for generating shapes that can be manufactured from materials which
allow for some stretching or shrinking like felt, leather, or thin wooden
boards. Most importantly, we show how to constrain the strip width parameters to model a class of intrinsically symmetric surfaces. These surfaces are
isometric to surfaces of revolution and can be covered with doubly-curved
panels that are produced with only a few molds when working with flexible
materials like metal sheets.
