##### **Abstract**
Geodesic parallel coordinates are orthogonal nets on surfaces where one
of the two families of parameter lines are geodesic curves. We describe a
discrete version of these special surface parameterizations and show that
they are very useful for specific applications, most of which are related to
the design and fabrication of surfaces in architecture. With the new discrete surface model, it is easy to control strip widths between neighboring
geodesics. This facilitates tasks such as cladding a surface with strips of
originally straight flat material or designing geodesic gridshells and timber
rib shells. It is also possible to model nearly developable surfaces. These are
characterized by geodesic strips with almost constant strip widths and are
used for generating shapes that can be manufactured from materials which
allow for some stretching or shrinking like felt, leather, or thin wooden
boards. Most importantly, we show how to constrain the strip width parameters to model a class of intrinsically symmetric surfaces. These surfaces are
isometric to surfaces of revolution and can be covered with doubly-curved
panels that are produced with only a few molds when working with flexible
materials like metal sheets.

Fig.: Architectural design in reference to designs by architect Frank Gehry. In our case the four surface patches are not developable, but are isometric to the
same surface of revolution. The rectangular metal sheets covering the surface can be produced using just one comparably small sector between two meridian
curves of the corresponding surface of revolution as a mold (left and Figure 16). The long vertical strip (left; gray) of the surface of revolution is either one big
mold or can be segmented into smaller molds if necessary. Metal sheets covering surface areas with almost vanishing Gaussian curvature can be produced
without a special mold, i.e., as developable surface patches.
