Very happy that a triply symmetric wooden shell structure designed by my numerical optimization result has been built in real life. More construction details see [Asymptotic Geodesic Timber Vault](https://eikeschling.com/2022/11/08/asymptotic-geodesic-timber-vault/) by Prof.Eike Schling et al.

Check the Deutch report in [News@Campus](https://www.baunetz-campus.de/news/asymptotic-geodesic-timber-vault-gitterschalen-mal-einfach-8117275).

Our research paper [***Architectural Structures from Quad Meshes with Planar Parameter Lines***](https://www.aag2023.com/#section2) has been accepted in Advances in Architectural Geometry (AAG) 2023 conference, which will be held in Stuttgart, Germany.

##### Final Result

    Compared with the later construction pipeline, what I did seems the most basic and easier one, since I only handled with scripts in the computer. It's a great chance for me to learn how an even simple project could be built in real life and to know how many steps to be followed into the final stage. Cheers for all the people involved!

    Animations. Numerical results that can be transferred into real life, touched, shared, and enjoyed by people is a great honor for the person sitting in front of the computer all day. It shows how well the algorithm and the construction are compatible with each other.

    Although this structure looks not so complex with many symmetries, it took me longer time to finally get the constructable mesh, since it satisfies so many constraints for a single mesh patch as seen above.

    Here is the final AAG-web with orthogonal straight strips along the asymptotic curves and tangent straight strips along the geodesics, which was optimized as discussed in this <a href="https://www.huiwang.me/projects/6_project/" target="\_blank"> project </a>.
